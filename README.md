We provide the code to reproduce the results of FIXME.

The path structures should be In onde folde:
- One "code" subfolder with all the codes
- one "data" folder that contains the raw and processed data
- one "results" to contain all the latex tables and the graphs

To execute all the files, only execute the file Routine.R

We describe the following files:

- functions.R: functions to make the double hurdle regressions on payment card and dichotomous choice surveys as well as the bussing walking graphs
- main_figures.R: the main results of the paper i.e. double hurdle regression for payment card and dichotomous choice surveys
- PC_elem_jun.R : double hurdle regression for payment card survey on junior high and elementary school subsets
- PC_elem_jun.R : double hurdle regression for dichotomous choice survey on junior high and elementary school subsets
- DC_check.R : double hurdle regression reproducing dichotomous choice responses using payment card surveys
- DC_check_elem_jun.R:double hurdle regression reproducing dichotomous choice responses using payment card surveys on junior high and elementary school subsets
- summary_stats: make the summary statistics table of the paper.
